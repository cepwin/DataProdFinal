##Description

The purpose of this application is to allow one to perform some very basic analysis of the data sets provided.

To use the app do the following
*Select one of the existing data set
*Select the x, y and z axis as well as an additional column "color." The data points color will be based on the value of this column.
*Click on "Plot the Data" and this will create a plotly plot (called "Exploratory Graph") based on the x, y, z and color values selected earlier.
